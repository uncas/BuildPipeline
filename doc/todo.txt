Current priorities:
- Deployment metod: FTP
-- Different deployment method per (ProjectId, EnvironmentId)
- Install script ('build.ps1 install')
- Configure which environments are available for each project.
- Display build stages + deployment stages on front page
- Attach release notes to commits.
- Show commits and release notes per deployment (via local mirror).

Feature ideas:
- API endpoint: Log start, Log success, Log failure, Log package
- Deployment: DeploymentMethod=OutOfProcess
-- OutOfProcess: Enqueue in some external rollout system,
   where the external rollout system sends status updates back to BuildPipeline
-- Alternative: BuildPipeline polls the external ssytem for status updates...
- Override deploy script per environment.
- Create package that can be deployed to a remote webserver.

Infrastructure / minor things:
- Display full version including short hash in footer on website.
- Logging: Take file name + line number from inner-most exception.
- TopShelf service instead of home-brewed service...
- Use twitter bootstrap

Architecture:
- Events & readmodels
-- EventStore (AggregateName, AggregateId, EventName, EventTime, SequenceNumber, Data)
--- Aggregates: Pipeline, Deployment, Environment
-- PipelineReadStore
- Job host
- Review existing read logic vs. write logic
- Write vs. read (commands and read models)

Documentation:
- Create dummy project for testing/demonstrating how to use it: BuildPipeline-Example
